## Introduction
Neuromancer is a static analysis script for files, aimed at detecting complete or approximate malware signatures. The signatures included in this script are only proof-of-concept at this time, and will be updated with actual signatures as they are indexed.

## How it works
Neuromancer works by comparing not only the signatures as a whole, but also the position of the bytes in the file. This ensures a greater coverage of samples from the same malware family. The user can refine their scans by adjusting the tolerance value in the main class.

## Key Features
- Static analysis of files
- Detection of complete or approximate malware signatures
- Comparison of both signatures and position of bytes in a file
- Adjustable tolerance value to refine scans
- 
## Usage
To use Neuromancer, simply run the script with the desired file as the input. The output will indicate whether the file matches any of the signatures in the database.

# Features
- Advanced language processing algorithms
- Ability to understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner
- Built-in knowledge database with information on a wide range of topics
